  Classes to prepare report plugins execution with Maven 3, through
  {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/MavenReportExecutor.html}MavenReportExecutor}}
  ({{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/DefaultMavenReportExecutor.html}implementation}}):
  report plugins can be configured in <<<\<configuration\>>>> element of <<<maven-site-plugin>>> or any other
  report building plugin with following XML model corresponding to plugin's
  <<<List<{{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/ReportPlugin.html}ReportPlugin}}>>>> parameter:

+----+
<reportPlugins>
  <reportPlugin>
    <groupId/>
    <artifactId/>
    <version/>
    <configuration/>
    <reports/>
    <reportSets>
      <reportSet>
        <id/>
        <configuration/>
        <reports/>
      </reportSet>
    </reportSets>
  </reportPlugin>
</reportPlugins>
+----+

  Notice this is the model from plugins in
  {{{/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html#class_reporting}<<<\<reporting\>>>> section of POM}}:

  * without <<<\<inherited\>>>> element: reporting plugins configuration inheritance is not supported at this level
  (see {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSITE-484}MSITE-484}}),

  * with additional <<<\<reports\>>>> list outside <<<\<reportSet\>>>> that simplifies reports configuration in usual cases,

  * with optional <<<\<version\>>>>: if no version is specified for a report plugin, version is determined by

    [[1]] searching for the plugin in the <<<build/plugins>>> section of the pom,
 
    [[2]] searching for the plugin in the <<<build/pluginManagement>>> section of the pom,

    [[3]] asking {{{/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/version/PluginVersionResolver.html}PluginVersionResolver}}
    to get a fallback version and display a warning as it's not a recommended use.

    []

  []

  Since <<<maven-reporting-exec>>> 1.2 (which is used by <<<maven-site-plugin>>> 3.4), plugin configuration in
  <<<build/pluginManagement>>> is injected into reports.

  Maven 3 core makes an automatic transformation of <<<\<reporting\>>>> POM section (which supports configuration inheritance)
  to <<<maven-site-plugin>>>'s <<<reportPlugins>>> configuration through the
  {{{/ref/current/maven-model-builder/apidocs/org/apache/maven/model/plugin/ReportingConverter.html}ReportingConverter}}
  component.

  Since 1.4, the request can be populated from pom's<<<\<reporting\>>>> section,
  injected as <<<$\{project.reporting.plugins\}>>> parameter value:

+----+
<project>
  [...]
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId/>
        <artifactId/>
        <version/>
        <configuration/>
        <reportSets>
          <reportSet>
            <id/>
            <configuration/>
            <reports/>
          </reportSet>
        </reportSets>
      </plugin>
    </plugin>
    [...]
  </reporting>
</project>
